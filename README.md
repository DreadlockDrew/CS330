1. How do I approach designing software?

When I'm designing software, I usually start by doing a thorough analysis of the project's requirements to get a decent high-level overview of what precisely I'm creating. I then start tasking out all of the project's components into category containers in preparation for later work distribution. After that is finished, I begin working on the current projects. In the more than two years that I have worked in the CS business, this approach has really paid off for me.

2. How do I approach developing programs?

In order to demonstrate to my client that the idea works and to solicit feedback for making the program as user-tailored as possible, I first build a functional minimum viable product. More of these cycles of development and feedback make up the remaining development period.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

By giving me a fulfilling work that supports my family and allows me to have fun, computer science aids me in achieving my goals. I haven't dreaded getting out of bed to go to work every day since I began working in the computer science industry.
